Brilliant. Absolutely freaking brilliant! This is up there with my top two films of the year. Holy crap I love this movie, to pieces that is much more than it is presented in anything you may have heard or seen from trailers or anything else. This is a great thriller hands down one of the best of the year and hands down Bong Joon-Ho’s is a masterful filmmaker that doesn’t hold back and pulls forward the audience to pay attention and understand what this movie is about. Not only that but also it lets the film get under your skin it truly is a bliss to watch a film by someone who never lets you go.

I know it feels pretentious or almost so snobby to put this at number 1. But I can tell you that nothing and I mean nothing (unless the rest of year will have great movies) but has this has to be my favorite movie of the year. I liked Hereditary and I think Ari Aster is a great filmmaker but this just elevated to a whole new level. The movie has themes and metaphors that will make any YouTuber’s dream to make a video about. But instead of it being a film where people will break down and try to explain piece by piece what it all means, how about actually taking a moment to realize wtf did we just watch. And I feel like being an American (and yes that is important) this film has become something truly horrifying but at that same time a movie where everything falls into place and it is happening before your very own eyes and you can not do anything to stop it. This film is f*cking genius. I’m not kidding I love this movie. From the opening shot to the very last frame this movie is constructed so seamlessly that it is warranted to question everything about this movie. Seriously the last hour is one big acid trip that you can’t run away from. It is at its heart a film about relationships and breakups also what it means to be a good boyfriend or girlfriend or even to be in a relationship with someone you love. Which honestly does change your viewpoint on relationships as a whole. Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor are just the best in every way but not just them and Will Potler but also all the natives at the festival are incredibly fantastic with their acting abilities to just acting like nothing wrong is going on and this is how things go. Which again is what I find terrifying. Loved it.

Finally, finally, finally! Leaving the theater I knew I witness something incredible. The only outcome I wish this film can do, is not only have people open their eyes to the possibilities not just superhero movies can go, but what cinema can offer. I understand what Martin said but this is how we show him and others wrong. Now not to say all comic book movies need to be like this. Hell no. But to offer new and exciting directions films can take us. DC has never been better putting quality film after quaintly film after another and this is the crown jewel of the whole dynasty. We may never see another film quite like this. But what we do have now is something capable and what films should be doing is having people understand the world we are living in is damage and broken and we can not expect others to do the work for us. Which is something Arthur believes he is doing but this is why it is a movie to bring us the possibilities if not done right. That is this story and if someone wants to make the counter of this film dealing with o I don't know everyone's favorite detective then maybe DC and WB have something here.

The two hours fly by and it is all to both Vince Gillian and Aaron Paul’s magnificent performance. This is a true and respectful continuation of one of the best shows of all time is incredible to watch. My eyes were glued to the screen like never before. This is what I’m fu*king talking about. They nailed to continue this story immediately after the show ended with almost pitch perfect settings and everyone in the cast stand out to being awesome. This is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of the year. And yes this is a movie. Not a TV movie but an actual experience of something we rarely see anymore and that is sure suspense filled with excellent performances from everyone. I don’t think it has anything to do with bias because Vince and everyone involved knows people who will watch this are fans of Breaking Bad. But even if you didn’t know that, this still feels like one hell of a ride. Full of laughs, tears, surprises, and absolute chaos. Which I love.

Yes it is as good as people say. Including myself who I was not ready to sing the praise when I got out of the theater after first viewing. Because I wanted to understand the full motive of why John Wick to stay alive. But then it hit me. This guy is staying alive for his wife. The one sole purpose for him to get out of the killing business and when she sent him the last thing to remember her by it was taken away. So it makes sense for him to stay alive so he keep the memory of his wife because he has nothing left. That and to me I also believe he wants to stay alive because no second rate hit man is going to kill John Wick. No 13 year old little girl is going to jump out of nowhere and kill him. This is John Wick.

Olivia Wilde knocks this film into a whole new level with the coming of age genre. Because she never forgets what it means to have two central characters being the vocal point of the story. Even with so many movies having a ton of characters they all fill empty and not much character development because they cram so many characters in one movie. This does not do that. The supporting characters do act as distractions rather elevate the material to make the relationship between the main girls be more real. Plus Billie Lorde is just flat out amazing in the film.

Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Thank you Netflix for having something this awesome. I know some people are up and arms over this movie because it another rape revenge movie. Or whatever people are having a problem with. But let me lay out a few things about this movie and movies about rape in general.

1.) Inconsistency-

If anyone remembers this movie that came out last year there is this movie called Revenge which is about a woman who goes on a rampage against the men who raped her. That movie has a 93% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. I don't buy this whole rape revenge genre is assaulting. Because it is directed by a male. But it still adds towards motivation. But that doesn't romanticize the rape because it was filmed with care and it didn't go to far. But it also didn't pull back.

2.) Empower-

Hollywood are going to continue to make movies that deal with #metoo events that have been happening. Hell look at A Vigilante which is one of my favorite movies this year. But let us remember this, it all relies on how it is filmed. The director of this film, Richard Shepard, is very talented and not once did I feel he was exploiting or even justifying the rape but taking a character like Charlotte making sense she would go to these extremes. But that is why I love this movie.

3.) Why it is great entertainment-

It plays with your damn head. Don't worry about the film trying to make a statement. Well it does actually because it is pretty simple. DON'T RAPE KIDS. Or else you will get what you deserve which it is awesome to watch.

First I love the Toy Story movies. 1-3 are amazing and noting short of masterpieces truly captivating these movies are something special to a lot of kids including myself who grew up with this franchise. And let me just say this movie is funny, touching, and really nice. But sadly that is just it. Nice. The film is a major let down on so many levels. But I do think it has a lot of charm but with the sacrifice of amazing characters from the past. I wish this was the Booksmart of the Toy Story franchise to focus primarily of Woody and Buzz spending their time together to find Boopeep. Even add Jessie in their for moral support to give Buzz a love interest. But their are so many characters in this film that do get in the way of the story. It is not something I despise but it was not the emotional gut punch so many people have said it out to be.
